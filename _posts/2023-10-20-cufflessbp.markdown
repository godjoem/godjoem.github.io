A novel **deep recurrent neural network (RNN)** model with optimal feature set of photoplethysmogram (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals for continuous blood pressure estimation. The model consists of 2-layered bidirectional LSTM and 6-layered LSTM networks, evaluated on 660 subjects from the UCI repository. It achieved RMSE of 3.223 and 1.781 mmHg for SBP and DBP, respectively, and MAE of 2.514 and 1.383 mmHg, attaining **grade A** according to British Hypertension Society (BHS) standards. The results demonstrate potential for developing wearable devices for real-time BP monitoring.
