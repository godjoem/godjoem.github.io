Sepsis is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Timely recognition and treatment in the emergency department (ED), often referred to as the golden window, are critical to improving outcomes. Yet, current diagnostic tools either demonstrate limited accuracy or rely on laboratory results that are not immediately available during initial ED evaluation. We developed the **Emergency Sepsis Risk Prediction (ESRP) score** using the AutoScore framework based on electronic health records from three health systems. The primary derivation cohort included all ED visits at 11 hospitals within the M Health Fairview system (Minnesota, 2019-2025). Two external cohorts include ED visits from BIDMC (Boston, 2011-2019, MIMIC-IV-ED database) and Stanford Health Care (2020-2022, MC-MED database). We evaluated its performance against commonly used bedside tools including qSOFA, NEWS, MEWS, and REMS, as well as logistic regression and random forest models. The ESRP score demonstrates superior performance for early and rapid sepsis identification in emergency departments across multiple healthcare systems.
