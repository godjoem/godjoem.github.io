**McBP-Net**, a deep learning model using a hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture with multimodal signals (PPG, IPG, ECG, and temperature) and handcrafted features, significantly improves the accuracy of continuous beat-to-beat blood pressure estimation. Validated on 23 subjects, it achieves mean absolute errors of 4.19 mmHg (SBP) and 2.98 mmHg (DBP), outperforming single and dual-modality approaches by up to 49.52%. The model demonstrates promising potential for medical-grade wearable cuffless dynamic BP measurements with strong generalizability across different BP levels.
