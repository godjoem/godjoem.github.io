A **qualitative phenomenological study** exploring risk perception evolution among medical staff during public health emergencies. Semi-structured interviews with 16 staff identified three stages: **Vigilance** (high alertness and active protection), **Observation** (standardized behaviors and emotional fluctuation), and **Maintenance** (normalized adaptation with stable response).
