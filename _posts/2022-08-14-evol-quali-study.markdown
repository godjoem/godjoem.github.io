A **qualitative phenomenological study** exploring the evolution of risk perception among medical staff during public health emergencies. Using semi-structured interviews with 16 medical staff and Colaizzi's 7-step analysis method, the study identified three evolutionary stages: (1) **Vigilance period** - multi-channel information access, high alertness, and active protective measures; (2) **Observation period** - standardized protective behaviors, monitoring public opinion, and emotional fluctuation with the epidemic; (3) **Maintenance period** - habitual attention to epidemic information, stable emotional response, and normalized adaptation. The findings provide insights for assessing medical staff risk perception, predicting behavioral changes, and guiding emotional responses during public health emergencies.
