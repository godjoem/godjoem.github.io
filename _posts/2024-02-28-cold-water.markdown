This study investigates the effects of **cold pressor test (CPT)** on heart rate (HR) and HR variability (HRV), which are clinically useful parameters for assessing autonomic nerve function and cardiovascular activities. Conducted on 22 subjects across 4 phases (Rest1, cold stimulus, recovery, Rest2), the study found that cold water exposure significantly increased HR (p<0.001) and decreased HRV, reflecting autonomic balance regulation. Notably, one hypertensive subject showed decreased HR during cold stimulus. These findings provide insights into autonomic system regulatory mechanisms and potential approaches for cardiovascular disease intervention and management.
