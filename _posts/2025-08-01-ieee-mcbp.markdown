Wearable cuffless blood pressure (BP) technology is emerging as a critical tool for monitoring hypertension, the leading risk factor of most cardiovascular diseases. We propose **multimodal McBP-Net**, built with hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture combining two-layer convolution operations with four-layer LSTMs to capture both local signal features and temporal dependencies for continuous dynamic beat-to-beat BP estimation. The McBP-Net includes photoplethysmographic, electrocardiographic, impedanceplethysmographic (IPG), and skin temperature (ST) signals as inputs. Validated on 23 subjects undergoing cold pressor test to induce large BP variability, the McBP-Net achieves the mean absolute errors of **4.19 and 2.98 mmHg** for systolic and diastolic BP, respectively. Published in **IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics (Volume 29, Issue 8, Pages 5438-5451)**.
