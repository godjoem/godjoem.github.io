We propose **multimodal McBP-Net**, a hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture for continuous beat-to-beat blood pressure estimation using PPG, ECG, IPG, and skin temperature signals. Validated on 23 subjects during cold pressor test, McBP-Net achieves mean absolute errors of **4.19 and 2.98 mmHg** for systolic and diastolic BP. Published in **IEEE JBHI (Volume 29, Issue 8)**.
