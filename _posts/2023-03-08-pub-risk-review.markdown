A **systematic review and meta-analysis** evaluating public risk perception levels and coping behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic across different countries. Searched 10 databases (PubMed, Cochrane, EMBASE, Web of Science, etc.) through March 2022, including 21 cross-sectional studies with 42,855 participants. Meta-analysis results show that 51.1% [95%CI (34.9%, 67.4%)] of the global public had high-level risk perception of COVID-19. The proportion of the public correctly wearing masks, maintaining hand hygiene, social distancing, and reducing travel were 53.2%, 63.9%, 48.5%, and 54.3% respectively. The study concludes that about half of the world's public demonstrated high risk perception and appropriate coping behaviors during the pandemic.
