Description
Wearable cuffless blood pressure (BP) technology is emerging as a critical tool for monitoring hypertension, the leading risk factor of most cardiovascular diseases. However, current cuffless BP methods are not accurate enough for clinical use, because they mainly use single or dual modalities/features as inputs for estimation. To address this challenge, we propose multimodal McBP-Net, built with hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture combing two-layer convolution operations with four-layer LSTMs to capture both local signal features and temporal dependencies for continuous dynamic beat-to-beat BP estimation. The McBP-Net includes photoplethysmographic, electrocardiographic, impedanceplethysmographic (IPG), and skin temperature (ST) signals as inputs. Validated on 23 subjects undergoing cold pressor test to induce large BP variability, the McBP-Net achieves the mean absolute errors of 4.19 and 2.98 mmHg …

Description
As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into clinical decision-making, ensuring transparent and trustworthy reasoning is essential. However, existing evaluation strategies of LLMs' medical reasoning capability either suffer from unsatisfactory assessment or poor scalability, and a rigorous benchmark remains lacking. To address this, we introduce MedThink-Bench, a benchmark designed for rigorous, explainable, and scalable assessment of LLMs' medical reasoning. MedThink-Bench comprises 500 challenging questions across ten medical domains, each annotated with expert-crafted step-by-step rationales. Building on this, we propose LLM-w-Ref, a novel evaluation framework that leverages fine-grained rationales and LLM-as-a-Judge mechanisms to assess intermediate reasoning with expert-level fidelity while maintaining scalability. Experiments show that LLM-w-Ref exhibits a strong positive correlation with expert judgments. Benchmarking twelve state-of-the-art LLMs, we find that smaller models (e.g., MedGemma-27B) can surpass larger proprietary counterparts (e.g., OpenAI-o3). Overall, MedThink-Bench offers a foundational tool for evaluating LLMs' medical reasoning, advancing their safe and responsible deployment in clinical practice.

Description
Aim: Continuous blood pressure (BP) monitoring can provide invaluable information for cardiovascular disease (CVD) diagnosis. The purpose of this study is to develop a deep recurrent neural network (RNN) model with an optimal feature set of photoplethysmogram (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals for continuous BP estimation.
Methods: This paper presents a novel deep recurrent neural network (RNN), which consists of 2-layered bidirectional Long Short-term Memory (Bi-LSTM) and 6-layered LSTM networks. It is used to estimate BP based on the optimal feature set of PPG and ECG signals. In this work, the optimal feature set is determined using five different feature selection methods.
Results: The proposed method is evaluated based on 660 subjects from the University of California Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository. The RNN model with optimal feature set achieved root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.223 and 1.781 mmHg for systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP), respectively. It also showed mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.514 and 1.383 mmHg for SBP and DBP, respectively. Regarding the British Hypertension Society (BHS) standard, the results attained grade A for the estimation of SBP and DBP.

Description
Importance: Sepsis is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Timely recognition and treatment in the emergency department (ED), often referred to as the golden window, are critical to improving outcomes. Yet, current diagnostic tools either demonstrate limited accuracy or rely on laboratory results that are not immediately available during initial ED evaluation, constraining rapid and reliable sepsis identification in the ED. Objective: To develop and externally validate a data-driven interpretable score for early identification of sepsis in the ED across three large health systems. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study used electronic health records from three health systems. The primary derivation cohort included all ED visits at 11 hospitals within the M Health Fairview system (Minnesota, 2019-2025). Two external cohorts include ED visits from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC, Boston, 2011-2019) extracted from the MIMIC-IV-ED database, and ED visits from the Stanford Health Care (Stanford, 2020-2022) sourced from the MC-MED database. In our analysis, completed in August 2025, we developed the Emergency Sepsis Risk Prediction (ESRP) score using the AutoScore framework. We evaluated its performance against commonly used bedside tools, including quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA), National Early Warning Score (NEWS), the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS), and the Rapid Emergency Medicine Score (REMS), as well as logistic regression (LR) and random forest (RF) models. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was sepsis diagnosis …
